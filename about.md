I am a computational biologist in the [Bock lab](https://www.bocklab.org/) at CeMM.  
Currently, I am in the middle of my PhD and I work on dissecting tumor heterogenity using integrative multi-omics analysis. 
Before moving to Vienna, I finished my studies in applied math and physics in Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.
